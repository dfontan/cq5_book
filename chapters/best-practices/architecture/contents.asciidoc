Ports And Adapters
------------------
Ports and Adapters or Hexagonal Architecture is a way to create a system that is decoupled from the under lying solution, so in a CQ solution you have very little CQ/Day imports in your views, domain, services and you would use adapters to plugin the application to the platform.

Ports are interfaces. 
Adapters are classes.
