Now we need to create the page component that the template will use

[source,jsp]
----
sys::[cd cq5_tutorial/global-cq-content/src/main/resources/jcr_root/apps/smithstone/components/page/homepage; git checkout master ; git show 8c1f3:./homepage.jsp ]
----
<1> This line of code is used to set the title with the content loaded from the CQ Page object.

This component includes all the necessary tags from the jstl core and the cq gloal tag which initialises objects on the page context that are needed for CQ development. + 
In the head we also use
[source,jsp]
----
<cq:include script="/libs/wcm/core/components/init/init.jsp"/>
----
This include setups up the jsp for editor mode or publish mode depending on its use.
This example is full of bad practices and I do not recommend writing code like. + 
We will see how to create better pages, templates in the upcoming best practices chapter.
