Template
~~~~~~~~
A template is a resource that is used for a page, we are going to construct a simple template and use it as the homepage for our site.
There is very little to a template

----
sys::[ cd cq5_tutorial/global-cq-content/src/main/resources/jcr_root/apps/smithstone/templates/; git checkout master ; git checkout a251a9; tree -a homepage ]
----

Below you will see a simple template that is going to be used as the template for the homepage.

.global-cq-content/src/main/resources/jcr_root/apps/smithstone/templates/homepage/.content.xml
[source,xml]
----
sys::[cd cq5_tutorial/global-cq-content/src/main/resources/jcr_root/apps/smithstone/templates/homepage; git checkout master; git show a251a9:./.content.xml ]
----

All templates should have a resourceType that points to a component this one points to 

----
smithstone/components/page/homepage
----



Page
~~~~
Now we need to create the page component that the template will use

[source,jsp]
----
sys::[cd cq5_tutorial/global-cq-content/src/main/resources/jcr_root/apps/smithstone/components/page/homepage; git checkout master ; git show 8c1f3:./homepage.jsp ]
----
<1> This line of code is used to set the title with the content loaded from the CQ Page object.

This component includes all the necessary tags from the jstl core and the cq gloal tag which initialises objects on the page context that are needed for CQ development.
In the head we also use
[source,jsp]
----
<cq:include script="/libs/wcm/core/components/init/init.jsp"/>
----
This include setups up the jsp for editor mode or publish mode depending on its use.
